Project Description - This project implements an AI-based Resume Screening System using Python and Machine Learning. The system automatically analyzes resumes and classifies them into suitable job categories based on skills, experience, and keywords. It helps recruiters reduce manual effort and improve shortlisting accuracy.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to clean and process resume text, while machine learning algorithms are applied for classification.

Objectives - 
Automate resume screening and classification
Reduce recruiter time and manual effort
Improve accuracy in matching resumes to job roles
Apply NLP and Machine Learning techniques on real resume data

Technologies Used - 
1.Python
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Scikit-learn
5.NLTK
6.Matplotlib
7.Seaborn
8.Jupyter Notebook
